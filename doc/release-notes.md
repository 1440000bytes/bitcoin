How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Knots that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Knots are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Knots is supported on operating systems using the Linux kernel,
macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use
Bitcoin Knots on unsupported systems.

From Bitcoin Knots 0.17.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.10 are no
longer supported, as Bitcoin Knots is now built using Qt 5.9.x which requires
macOS 10.10+. Additionally, Bitcoin Knots does not yet change appearance when
macOS "dark mode" is activated.

Users running macOS Catalina should "right-click" and then choose "Open" to
open the Bitcoin Knots .dmg. This is due to new signing requirements and
privacy violations imposed by Apple, which the Bitcoin Knots project does not
implement.

Notable changes
===============

New RPC
-------

- `getgeneralinfo` is an experimental method to give you the client version as
  a string, the user-agent string, data directory, blocks directory, and time
  the node started.

Updated RPC
-----------

- The `createmultisig` and `addmultisigaddress` methods will now return an
  output descriptor (in addition to what they already returned previously).

- If the new IP->AS map support is enabled (by loading a map file), the
  `getpeerinfo` method will include a "mapped_as" key with the AS number for
  the peer's IP.

- `getblockfilter` can now support the "v0" block filter type if enabled
  explicitly with `-blockfilterindex=v0`.

GUI changes
-----------

- Additional support for manipulating PSBTs, including fee bumping and a new
  "PSBT Operations" dialog, have been added.

- When entering a slightly-wrong Bech32 address, the first incorrect character
  will be distinguished in an underlined, bold, yellow colour.

PSBT (BIP174) change
--------------------

- Support for serialization of the `GLOBAL_XPUB` field has been added.

P2P changes
-----------

- Experimental support for using IP->AS map files (not included) in peer
  selection to mitigate the Erebus attack and similar threats. To load a map
  file, use the new `-asmap` option.

- If Tor is installed system-wide, but not running or accessible, Bitcoin Knots
  will run its own private instance for incoming connections over Tor only
  (including pairing with wallets). If you don't want Knots to communicate over
  Tor for some reason, you can disable this with the `-torexecute=0` option.
  In that case, we would appreciate if you report your reasons for not wanting
  this enabled to the PR for Bitcoin Core here:
      https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15421

- If a peer informs us they no longer have a transaction we're requesting,
  immediately try to get it from another peer rather than waiting for the
  request to timeout.
